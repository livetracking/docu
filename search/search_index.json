Deposit your access data in Settings > Upload settings > Custom livetracking settings . The app supports ANT+ and Bluetooth sensors. You can transfer your speed, heart rate, cadence and power as well as the GPS coordinates. Output This software is very much based on InfluxDB . So you have all the advantages of a very fast time series database. It aims to answer queries in real-time. Each user comes with his own InfluxDB database for live tracking. Only you as an owner can write to the database. You can give other users read rights to your live tracking database. Currently you can save 8 hours of data. If you make your profile public, anyone can view your data at the following URL: https://your-domain.local/public/YOUR-USERNAME If your profile is not public, your friends can view your data at the following URL: https://your-domain.local/watch/YOUR-USERNAME Because you have your own InfluxDB database, you can also use other evaluation programs. A popular program is e.g. Grafana . Use the URL https://your-domain.local and the database name YOUR-USERNAME . Developers Welcome You can use this software as the back end for live tracking. It is very easy to integrate into existing apps. The back-end is coded in PHP. Data is stored in a SQLite and InfuxDB database. The transfer is done via an HTTP API.

InfluxDB requires a measurement name. Always use the name: samples Field keys are required and are always strings, and, by default, field values are floats. The timestamp - supplied at the end of the line in Unix time in nanoseconds since January 1, 1970 UTC - is optional. If you do not specify a timestamp the server\u2019s local nanosecond timestamp in Unix epoch is used. Anything that has to do with time is always UTC. They can adjust the precision by parameter.","title":"[POST] /write"},{"location":"Writing-Data.html#query-string-parameters","text":"","title":"Query String Parameters"},{"location":"Writing-Data.html#dbdatabase","text":"Required!
